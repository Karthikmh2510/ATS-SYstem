Here I am trying to build an ATS Chat system which takes
job descriptions listed in the job portal and user need to 
upload their resume. 

After, going through the resume, this system will suggest the 
necessary changes, skill upgradation and, ATS score of that resume.



Task need to be completed in following stpes:

1. Creating a field to put job descriptions.
2. It should accepts the PDF to be uploaded.
3. Need to convert PDF to Image, this can be done by Google Gemini Pro model.
4. Need to create multiple prompt template for different tasks.

Most Important thing to do,
Need to download zip file of Poppler and copy paste 
Library and Share folders to "C" drive, program files(x86).
Create a new folder poppler nd paste library and share folders.
Next, add this bin path to environment variable in system.

### app.py code contains the code which is quite
difficult, as it converts the pdf to images and images to byte
and then it processes using gemini model.

### app1.py is simple, it extracts texts from PDF
and use those text to get the output.
